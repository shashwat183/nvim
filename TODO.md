# TODO

- [] Fix issue - rest.nvim http treesitter syntax highlighting
- [] Checkout nvim-treesitter-textobjects(it is setup in kickstart config so use that to understand better)

# Done

- [x] Path based completion in nvim-cmp.
- [x] Buffer based completion in nvim-cmp.
- [x] indent-blankline contextual highlighting like in nvchad(looks much better than the line based highlighting in current config)
- [x] Install autopairs
- [x] Diagnostics in nvim-tree |Note| -  Just doesn't work for lua(don't care) and jdtls(probably need to configure more).
- [x] Pyright fidget integration
- [x] Install which-key
- [x] In keymaps, change the opts var to a function that accepts a desc string and return a new opts map with same values plug the desc.
- [x] Signature help is not working in Java(jdtls). Investigate.
- [x] Hamcrest imports are not detected by autocompletion. Have to manually specify the parent package
- [x] XML lsp setup
- [x] JSON lsp setup
- [x] More lsp config stuff to be pulled out of old config
- [x] Typescript lsp setup
- [x] Git plugins - vimfugitive(its amazing) -> checkout this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUrKrYCAl1Y, vim-rhubarb
